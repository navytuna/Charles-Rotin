Note: This will contain a lot of discussion amongst myself, and it may be confusing to some people.

I am drawing a blank on what to discuss here. Perhaps I will come up with something tomorrow? I doubt I will, although developments may emerge in the Fireteam hangout or Origins' mod hangout. In any case, I suspect that I should get moving on both the edits that have been requested of me, Dysze's "Situation", maybe help Wighen, and I should definitely get a move on the fireteam RP. Actually, I belive there are two that I am overdue to participate in, although one of them may have died out on someone else's turn. It matters not.
